# SVM-SGD

## Overview
This project implements a soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) model used for binary classification optimized with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) from scratch. It serves as an educational tool for those interested in understanding the underlying mathematics and optimization techniques behind SVMs.

## Features
- Soft-margin Support Vector Machine implementation from scratch
- Utilizes Stochastic Gradient Descent for optimization
- Evaluation using F1 score

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python svm_classifier_sgd.py`.
